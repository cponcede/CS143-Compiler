The following bug fixes were made for PA3 regrade. Nearly all of the bug fixes
involved changing error message wording.

1. Fixed error message for semantic error involving an attribute with name 'self'. 
Our original error missage was missing an "an". This was tested in anattributenamedself.cl. 
(code change around semant.cc:758)

2. Fixed error message for assignnoconform.cl to match the solution's error message. 
This is the semantic error involving an assignment expression not conforming to the declared
type of its identifier. 
(code change around semant.cc:837)

3. Instead of giving a "Redefinition of basic class Int" error message for redefining 
basic classes, we gave an error message that told the programmer that the class with name 
Int was defined multiple times. To fix the error message, an explicit check for the basic 
classes to print the correct message was added. This fixed redefine-io.cl and 
badredefineint.cl.
(code change around semant.cc:110)

4. We failed the inheritsself.cl and inherit-self.cl because our error message for
inheriting type SELF_TYPE was missing a terminating ".". This has been fixed. 
(code change around semant.cc:106)

5. Fixed error message for when the body of a method does not conform to its declared
return type. This fixes selftypebadreturn.cl, wrong-ret-type.cl, and lubtest.cl
(code change around semant.cc:740)

6. Fixed error message for incompatible formal argument types in redefined method to 
match the solution. This bug was caught in the test for overridingmethod4.cl. 
(code change around semant.cc:687)

7. Fixed error message for redefining a class to match the solution. This fixed redefinedclass.cl
and multi-class-decl.cl. The required bug fix was to add basic classes to the ClassTable before
the classes defined in the program.
